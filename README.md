# nodeServiceExperiment
A newbie experiment about building a REST service application on Node.js without any specific framework except, maybe, RxJs

At the moment, the service can perform the following functions:
- receive Http requests
- send Http requests to external services

## Project structure
This project consists of two main parts:
- self-made microframework 
- custom logic layer

## Additional features:
- automatic feature discovery
- external configuration using Yaml
- logging
